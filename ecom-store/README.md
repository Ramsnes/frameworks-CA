## Frameworks, library or other components used

### **React** [react.dev] (https://react.dev/)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. Developed and maintained by Facebook, React allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. It uses a component-based architecture, where the UI is broken down into reusable components, each managing its own state. This approach enhances the development process by promoting modularity, reusability, and better organization of code.

### **Material UI** [mui.com](https://mui.com/)

Material-UI is a React component library that implements Google's Material Design guidelines. It provides a robust, customizable, and accessible set of components that make it easy to build sleek and responsive user interfaces. By using Material-UI, developers can leverage a wide range of pre-designed components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation elements, which help ensure a consistent look and feel across the application. The library also supports extensive theming capabilities, allowing for easy customization to fit the specific needs of any project.
